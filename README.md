# Socket-IO-Demo
Just a simple React + Node app built with Socket.IO for low-latency, bidirectional communication. 

### Usage
Execute `npm install` command in both frontend and backend folders launch the project. The app will be launched in `localhost:3000`. Open another window, say an incognito window and search for the same URL. Now, these two windows are considered as separate users and they'll be able to chat in real-time, leveraging Socket.IO's bidirectional, real-time communication capability.
